    ## Description
    In this project I wanted to create a team generator so I can easily see who is on my team.  I learned how to create and run unit tests to make sure my code is running how it is intended to run.  I used prompt with inquirer to ask the user questions about the team members. I used classes and subclasses to help generate the team members. I used fs to write the html. I used bootstrap to help with the css and fontawesome for the icons.
